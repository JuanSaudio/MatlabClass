% FREQ2ERB frequency to equivalent rectangular bandwidth conversion
%
% usage: erb = freq2erb(freq)
% 
% This function simply computes the equivalent rectangular bandwidth
% position of the corresponding frequency. Keep in mind that ERBs are a
% perceptually based scale and do not extend or generalize outside their
% intended purpose. Use with care for this reason both in extreme cases
% where the purpose doesnt entirely apply and where the frequency range
% doesnt entirely apply.
%
% The ERB scale is a model of listening critical bands where a full ERB
% shares particular perceptual characteristics based on masking curves,
% equal loudness perception and even complex tone integration. Notice
% however that any of these can be affected by other objective signal
% properties like loudness and timbre.
